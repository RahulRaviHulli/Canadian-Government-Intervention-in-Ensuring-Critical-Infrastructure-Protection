# Canadian Government Intervention in Ensuring Critical Infrastructure Protection
The Government of Canada is following a set of preventive measures to keep the country safe, whereby these assets are great institutions both in terms of social cohesion and national security. The model is a two-phase classification approach that is efficient in dealing with core sectors of infrastructure, which include government, transport, energy, utilities, and the finance sector. The risk assessment, which includes all cyber-attacks, theft, terrorism, and natural calamity identification, is of major significance. The government makes use of its instruments, including lawmaking, enacting, and uniting forces through collaboration with stakeholders, to minimize risks and increase resilience. The National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructures provides a solution by having a significant effect on security issues like recovery, response, and readiness plans. The problem of public opinion is also to be solved, along with those related to people's readiness for new dangerous situations and the rules, which in some cases may hamper survival. The Canadian government is as alarmed about dismantling the critical pillars of their society as the major players in this game, such as social well-being and national security.
